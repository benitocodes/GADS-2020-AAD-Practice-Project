# GADS-2020-AAD-Practice-Project

# Introduction.
This is a simple Android Project aimed at implementing some simple concepts that are very important as far as Android Development is concerned and it was developed during Google Africa Developer Scholarship 2020 phase 2 as a practice project. In this project I implemented a mobile design of the GADS 2020 Leaderboard. The mobile App displays Top 20 learners in two different categories such as learning hours and skill IQs.

The project makes use of: Multi-Activity Project, View pager, Customizing Toolbar, RecyclerView, Making Network Request using Retrofit, Working with Google Form and Much more.
